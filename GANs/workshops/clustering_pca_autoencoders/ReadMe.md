# PSIML PCA/Autoencoder Workshops

This directory contains source code for the PCA/Autoencoder workshop used during the PSIML seminar.

## Idea

The workshop consist of a two main tasks:
* First, you are given data points in 3D obtained in the following way:
  * The 2D Robot logo of our seminar is extended into 3D by adding small random noise
  * You are about to apply PCA to the dataset in order to retrieve the importnt dynamics, i.e. our robot logo
* Second, you create an autoencoder and train it to reproduce images of digits from MNIST.

## Have fun! -NN
